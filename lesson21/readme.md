# Test Execution and Reporting

To run the tests and generate the report for this project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run report
```

The tests are written using Playwright steps, which means the report clearly shows the test logic. This makes it easy to understand and can even serve as documentation for the project.

## Example Report Screenshot

Below is an example of an Allure report generated after running the tests:
